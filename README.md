SOTEC website redesign
=======================

- General
  * simplify styling, clean things up
  * fewer linked pages -- possibly one - two pages with dynamic content?

  ** easier to edit information -- create json file with data?

- About Section
  * carousel linked to instagram account
  * description with contact info

- Staff Section
  * redesign to be grid of profile pictures with names
     - details expand into popOver on click
  * new captions needed for staff, list of who to include and what titles

- Calendar
  * ideally stand-alone -- not linked to google account
  * list upcoming events on main page with full calendar elsewhere
